# A Simple Latex Resume

Recently I've been itching to redo my resume completely. I was using a template I found back in 2015 copyrighted to "2006-2013 Xavier Danaux (xdanaux@gmail.com)" it served me well and introduced me to lots of syntax, as I forced it to do my bidding for a decade. I will always rememeber my memories with this class fondly but it was time for a change.

I thought about finding a new template but the beauty of making my own is I know exactly how it works and can make any future edits I need. I'm also looking for something pretty simple, without a lot of fluff.

This resume format has 3 main sections
1. A Header with Name, goal title, contact info, and a short short personal statement
2. A skills section, with the ability to categorize skills 
3. Experience sections, which consist of jobs, education, whatever can be expressed as a name, organization, location, date range, and descriptive text

The provided main.txt shows an example resume with Gen AI generated content.
